# Solar Tracker
My project is the Solar Tracker, a device that can rotate a solar panel to the position where the sunlight is brightest. This was achieved through photoresistors placed around the sides of the device and two servos for rotating and tilting the solar panels.

# Final Milestone
After sucessfuly installing the solar panel array, rebuilding the base to be stronger, and reworking the code, I completed my version of the Solar Tracker. Over the course, my biggest challenges were (1) how it would only rotate between two angles, (2) the extra sensors were unnecessary and draining power, (3) multiple code versions had to be tested and changed, (4) the solar panel array was too large for the original setup, and (5) the original servo motors were not strong enough to hold the weight of the solar panel array. 
To improve on this, I (1) used all four photoresistors to determine the best lighting position, (2) removed the extra sensors and related code, (3) reworked and adjusted that code for different setups, (4) increased the strength and stability of the base, and (5) replaced the original servo motors with higher torque servo motors.

I learned Arduino and can now use the program to manipulate robots and analyze code. Also, I improved my skills in electrical and mechanical engineering which will be useful in my future career as an engineer.

# Second Milestone
Regarding the code for the Solar Tracker, I chose to go for an approach which made use of all 4 photoresistors and compared their values to rotate to the correct position. This had more success than previously, but still needed some adjustments to the code and photoresistor placement. Originally, the photoresistors were in a fixed position on the base of the Solar Tracker, but in the new version, they would be placed on the edges of the solar panel array. This would allow the code to better adjust to light changes as the photoresistor values would also be changing when the solar panel array rotated. The code has been the largest problem so far, but I am confident it will work.

When the servos would rotate the solar panel, the whole project would shake as it made large turns/tilts. The structure of the Solar Tracker needed to be disassembled and rebuilt to create a taller and more stable base that allows the solar panel array to rotate fully. The wires and copper pillars were extended to accommodate for the height, and a larger backboard was added behind the solar panel array to have a stabler hold for the servos.

# First Milestone
I wanted the Solar Tracker to be able to rotate to the strongest source of light. I started with the solar panel, two servo motors, light intensity meter, photoresistors, and the Arduino Uno. The Arduino Uno will  adjust the solar panel after reading and comparing the values given by the photoresistors and light intensity meter.

After assembling the servos together and situating the photoresistors on the sides of the solar panel, the code I had started with split rotation and tilt into two functions - one done by the side photoresistors and the other done by the vertical photoresistors. This method seemed inefficient because the solar panel would only rotate 180 degrees and wasnâ€™t tilting at all. This was the main problem I encountered when creating the Solar Tracker and will be one of the focuses of the Second Milestone.
